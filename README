  Mini_car project by gordon.yiu@gmail.com

I just want to put my effort building a very simple car and share.
This car is purchased from Raspberry with RPI 2 model B, two DC motors, two encoders, one PWM with I2C bus, and a L298N.
I get several module from Adafruit for PWM control and I2C. And one pid  control algorithm from cnr437@gmail.com, decorate it and implement my own
